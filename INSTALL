Installing using apipropriate profiles
======================================

The "light" profile should have the fewest dependencies on other software. So
this profile doesn't need a separate database, webserver and applicationserver.
So this should only be used for testing and small application scenarios.

For the "light" profile see: doc/ecs_light_installation.txt
